I understand you want the complete, professional README.md content again. Here it is, ready for you to copy and paste into your GitHub repository.🩺 MediPredict: Advanced Diabetes Early Detection💡 Project OverviewMediPredict is an AI-powered web application designed to provide a rapid, preliminary, and non-diagnostic risk assessment for Type 2 Diabetes. \This project successfully bridges the gap between machine learning model development and real-world application deployment.Utilizing a trained Logistic Regression classifier, the system processes key clinical and demographic parameters entered by the user through a guided, multi-step web form. The primary objective is to generate an immediate, clear Risk Probability and an actionable Medical Report, thereby empowering users with timely information regarding their health risk factors.This project is an excellent demonstration of Full-Stack Machine Learning Deployment (MLOps) using Python and a micro web framework.✨ Features & Value PropositionFeatureDescriptionAI-Powered PredictionIntegrates a pre-trained Logistic Regression model for accurate binary classification (Diabetic/Non-Diabetic) and probability output.Guided Data CollectionA highly intuitive, 3-Step Patient Assessment Form that organizes data input logically (Demographics, Vitals, Advanced Parameters).Real-Time Risk MetricsGenerates an Estimated Probability (e.g., $44.7\%$) and a categorized assessment (Low, Medium, High Risk) instantly upon submission.Professional ReportOutputs a structured, shareable MEDICAL REPORT summarizing input data, prediction, and risk level.Actionable RecommendationsIncludes personalized, evidence-based recommendations on lifestyle, diet, and monitoring to promote better health management.Modern UI/UXBuilt with a clean, responsive interface focusing on readability and clinical presentation.⚙️ Tech Stack and DependenciesThe application is built on a standard Python-based architecture:Backend: Python 3.xWeb Framework: [Flask / Django] (Choose your framework)Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for the model), Pandas (for data handling), NumPy (for mathematical operations).Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.📜 RequirementsAll required Python libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.🚀 Local Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to set up and run the MediPredict application on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.x installed.git installed.Step 1: Clone the RepositoryClone the project to your local machine using Git:Bashgit clone https://github.com/VAMSI-TU/MediPredict-Advanced-Diabetes-Early-Detection.git
cd MediPredict-Advanced-Diabetes-Early-Detection
Step 2: Set Up Virtual EnvironmentIt is essential to install dependencies in a virtual environment (venv/).Bash# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Install DependenciesInstall all necessary libraries using the provided requirements.txt file:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Run the ApplicationStart the server. (Use your actual startup command, e.g., python app.py or flask run)Bashpython run.py
The application will now be running. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the specific port shown in your terminal).📸 Application WalkthroughThe interface guides the user through the input process, culminating in a clear risk report.Assessment StepDescriptionScreenshot (Path Example)Step 1/3: DemographicsInput patient name, age, and number of pregnancies.assets/Screenshot 2025-11-29 232307.jpgStep 2/3: VitalsInput critical clinical measurements: Glucose, Blood Pressure, Insulin, and Skin Thickness.assets/Screenshot 2025-11-29 232331.jpgStep 3/3: Advanced ParametersInput BMI and Diabetes Pedigree Function—two key predictive factors.assets/Screenshot 2025-11-29 232414.jpgFinal ReportDisplays the prediction: Risk Classification, Estimated Probability, and Recommendations.assets/Screenshot 2025-11-29 232622.jpg(Note: You must ensure your images are pushed to a directory named /assets or similar in your repository for these links to work.)⚖️ License and DisclaimerLicenseThis project is released under the MIT License.
